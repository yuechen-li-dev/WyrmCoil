# WyrmCoil Architecture Overview

WyrmCoil is the top-level engine-core project.

Dunewyrm is the embedded deterministic control kernel.

Engine is the dense-store / act-bridge layer and now hosts the reintegrated WyrmCoil engine prototype under `src/Engine/`.

See also `docs/Dunewyrm/architecture.md` for the Dunewyrm runtime contract.


## Milestone status

- **M1b (complete):** Dunewyrm is fully reintegrated as an embedded kernel module under `src/Dunewyrm/` and intentionally re-exported from `src/lib.rs` for external use.
- **M2 (complete):** Engine prototype behavior is reintegrated under `src/Engine/` with product-facing names (`Engine`, `World`, `Vec2`, `EntityId`, etc.) replacing legacy `Wc*` prototype prefixes where appropriate.
- **External proof:** Guard Patrol remains available via integration tests that consume public WyrmCoil/Dunewyrm APIs.


Dunewyrm `Dw*` names remain intentionally prefixed to mark embedded-kernel APIs, while Engine-layer product names live unprefixed inside the WyrmCoil namespace.
